        <p>
            Don't know a single thing about websites and coding, but I still wanted to make a small gesture for you in a way that would appeal to you the best.  
            So here's a card I made for you. I hope you love it.  
            I love you so much and I'm so grateful to have you. I know I say this a lot, but I think even that isn't enough.  
            I want you to conquer the world, and I want to be by your side to see you do it all.  
            I love you so much. Can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
